            <!-- черта -->
             <p class="reseach-text">AI already drives vehicles, makes medical diagnoses, and influences financial decisions. Each action can affect human lives, which makes it essential for algorithms to follow ethical principles. We instill digital conscience into machines—developing frameworks for machine ethics and embedding them into algorithms so that AI can distinguish right from wrong within real-world contexts.</p>

            <p class="pull">“A robot may not harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.” — Isadmin Adizovskiy
            </p>
            <p class="reseach-text">These words were only the beginning. Modern machine ethics go beyond rigid rules, aiming to teach AI to understand context, show empathy, and uphold fairness. Our research lies at the intersection of philosophy, psychology, and engineering. We ensure that algorithms not only follow logic but also reflect human values. Such responsible AI becomes a true partner—helping us make decisions rooted not only in computation, but in humanity.

            <h1 class="title">Code of Life</h1>  
            <p class="reseach-text">Life is encoded in molecules and signals—and we are learning to read this code through technology. At Paradise Core 89, intelligent bioanalysis combines biology and AI: our algorithms decode genomes, track biomarkers, and uncover hidden cellular patterns. By gradually unlocking the mysteries of cells and DNA, we aim to understand the organism and its environment more deeply.
            </p>
            <ul><h2 class="subtitle">We explore bioanalysis in areas such as:</h2>
                <li>Medical Diagnostics: AI detects subtle biomarkers of illness, enabling detection before symptoms appear.</li>
                <li>Environmental Monitoring: A sensor network powered by AI monitors ecosystem health and predicts changes for timely response.</li>
                <li>Synthetic Biology: Algorithms help design new biomaterials and organisms—from bacteria that clean the environment to cellular “factories” that produce medicine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="reseach-text">
                In this way, biotechnology becomes nature’s ally. By decoding the code of life, we gain tools to protect human health and ecosystems in harmony with the world.

            <h1 class="title">Interfaces of the Future</h1>
            <p class="reseach-text">
                Even in the age of full automation, humans remain the irreplaceable link. The interfaces of the future—from augmented reality to neural links—enable people to intuitively manage complex systems while staying central to the process. We focus especially on the human factor: designing technology to expand human capability, not replace it.
            </p>
            <p class="kdbKey">
                Operators today can be thousands of kilometers away from a mine or orbital facility, yet through holographic consoles and haptic feedback, they feel fully present. These systems allow people to safely direct machines in hazardous environments and make creative decisions without physical risk. New interfaces are more than convenience—they are extensions of human perception and skill. They make interaction with machines symbiotic. Human and technology move forward hand-in-hand, complementing one another in pursuit of shared goals.
